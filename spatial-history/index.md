# Japanese Internment: "No" & "No"

Executive Order 9066, signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt on February 19, 1942,
started the process of Japanese internment that would continue into 1946 in the
United States.  Hundreds of thousands of Japanese people--the majority of whom
were also American citizens--were put into camps throughout the U.S.

Tule Lake was similar to the other nine camps until 1943, when the "loyalty
questionnaire" was released.  The U.S. was in need of more soldiers and activists
asked the government to give the Japanese people a chance to prove themselves
as loyal Americans.  The questionnaire overall was unfair and vague, but two
particular questions, 27 & 28, caused controversy:

"27. *Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty, wherever ordered?*"

"28. *Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America and faithfully defend the United States from any and all attacks by foreign and domestic forces, and forswear any form of allegiance or disobedience to the Japanese Emperor, or any other foreign government, power, or organization?*"



Your first task will be to locate some real places.  You can get the precise locations at various services, e.g [latlong.net](http://www.latlong.net/).

Then add those places to the marker array in [../js/maps-setup.js](../js/maps-setup.js) (see instructions there).

replace this text and the text with your essay. But be sure not to eliminate the html elements that
are contained inside this textarea, or [your map won't work at all!][1] [1](#one)

It makes sense to put an introductory paragraph here, above the map and buttons. To change the bootswatch thenme, change "united" to one of the other theme names listed at [strapdownjs.com](http://strapdownjs.com/).

The rest of your essay should go under the map, probably.

## in sections like this
also _italics_ and __bold__ which can also be written *like this* or **like this**
etc. Be sure to [make use of links](http://digital.hackinghistory.ca) -- that's one of the reasons we write on the Web, and I've asked you to use links for all yor footnotes/references as well.
