# Gaman: Keeping Strong

In light of the news that [the proposed 2019 budget will not accommodate funding for the preservation of history regarding Japanese internment in the United States][1], along with the [proposal to building a fence through the historic Tule Lake site][2] (thus destroying much of the history associated with it), this essay will explore the relationship between space, place, people, and events in order to explain the true impact of relocation on the Japanese-American population.  With threats of things like a “Muslim registry” about, it is important to remember and preserve histories of oppression in America (a great site using Japanese internment to discuss post-9/11 oppression can be found [here](https://japaneseinternmentmemories.wordpress.com/)).

In 1942, Executive Order 9066 was signed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, allowing for the [internment of Japanese people][3] throughout the United States of America.  They were forced into one of ten relocation centres throughout the U.S.

According to the 1940 census, [93,717 Japanese people were living in California][4], and about [120,000 Japanese people were incarcerated in camps][3], meaning that around 78%[<sup>1</sup>](#one) of the Japanese population incarcerated had lived in California.  Most of this population (at least [39%, just from Los Angeles][4]) came from south California.  Yet, only two internment camps ([Tule Lake and Manzanar][5]) were in California and many had to go to different states and live in vastly different conditions.  The closest camps (within 500 miles[<sup>2</sup>](#two)) were [Manzanar, Poston, and Gila River][5].

In order to understand how far many people were sent, the [demographic makeup of each camp][5] would have to be analyzed.  Los Angeles can be used as a point of assessment, since it had the highest Japanese population in America in 1940.  Manzanar had the most people from Los Angeles--around 8,828 internees--but many people went much further.  At least 7,000 people altogether went to Rohwer and Jerome, which are at least 1,784 miles away from Los Angeles.  In total, around 17,100 people (46%) of the population of Los Angeles traveled more than 500 miles away from what they considered home[<sup>3</sup>](#three).  Even so, all camps were still at least 200 miles away from Los Angeles, and many internees were relocated multiple times[<sup>4</sup>](#four).

# No-No & Tule Lake

One of the major events that led to mass relocations after the initial passing of 9066 happened in 1943, when the Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI, which funnily enough, is a type of demon in Japanese mythology[<sup>5</sup>](#five)) and the War Relocation Authority banded together to create a [Loyalty Questionnaire][6].  This questionnaire assessed how “American” or “Japanese” individuals were in order to figure out which internees would stay loyal to America if they were drafted into the military.  Those who were assessed to be more American than Japanese became eligible to leave.  

In particular, two questions, [27 and 28][7], confused many people:

"27. *Are you willing to serve in the armed forces of the United States on combat duty, wherever ordered?*"

"28. *Will you swear unqualified allegiance to the United States of America and faithfully defend the United States from any and all attacks by foreign and domestic forces, and forswear any form of allegiance or disobedience to the Japanese Emperor, or any other foreign government, power, or organization?*"

These questions, as well as the concept of drafting Japanese men into the war after being forced into internment camps, caused unrest and even riots.  Many thought the questions may be some sort of trap intended to persecute them further, especially since many of them never had the sort of connection to Japanese politics the questions assumed they did.  Many refused to answer the questions or put “no” for both 27 and 28, earning them the name “[No-No Boys][8]”.  

The No-No Boys[<sup>6</sup>](#six) and others who refused to fill out the questionnaire or be drafted into the war were heavily punished and sent to [Tule Lake camp][9], which was converted into a “segregation centre” with stricter regulations and harsher treatment.  Anyone previously at Tule Lake who complied could choose to stay or go to other camps, and about 6,000 people chose to stay due to ill family members or reluctance to move.  The WRA insisted that the No-No Boys and other rioters were the true enemies of the Japanese-American people, hoping to cause a divide amongst the Japanese people in America (which was somewhat successful).

Tule Lake reached its peak population, [18,789, in 1944][10], meaning that 15% of the Japanese population in America was forced to stay at Tule Lake (the highest population of any camp).  Most people in Tule Lake were from Sacramento ([~27%][10]), meaning that most people were forced to move at least 300 miles away from home.  Since many people were coming from other camps, it is safe to assume most had traveled even more than 300 miles.  Due to the stress of moving, segregation, and the harsh conditions of the camp, Tule Lake residents became the target of [Public Law 405][9], where they were encouraged to renounce their citizenship.  After their release in 1946, many residents were deported to Japan or became homeless.  Many tried to get their citizenship back afterwards, but the damage had been done[<sup>7</sup>](#seven).

Tule Lake camp was a place of tragedy and pain as well as resistance and strength for many, and still serves as a reminder of part of America’s terrifying racist past[<sup>8</sup>](#eight).  The map above shows the distance between the camps, yet it does not even fit all of the camps correctly!  (Feel free to click and drag the map, as well as zoom in and out.)  This representation will hopefully provide people with an understanding of just how far the 9066 reached, as well as the [types of spaces they were usually in][11] (dry with severe weather).  In addition, the box shown provides an approximation of where the highest population of Japanese-Americans lived.  The hope is that, in zooming out and looking around, one can get a sense of just how far the majority of internees were forced to go.  Tule Lake is highlighted in a red marker (instead of blue) as a way to single it out as the most oppressive and highly populated camp.

# Relationships Across Time and Space
In conclusion, stories of Japanese internment often avoid looking at relations between people, space, place, and events.  Much more went on than discussed here, but major events led to further relocation and the shifting of huge portions of the population.  Historical events impact the way people moved and where they were moved to.  The flow of people to and from different places and how it impacts them should be measured and understood.  If anything, hopefully this essay brings to light the scope of the internment process and why sites such as Tule Lake are so important and necessary to preserve.

1) <a id="#one"></a> A lot of the percentages in this essay came by using numbers from different sources cited throughout.

2) <a id="#two"></a> The mileage may be slightly inaccurate as distances were calculated by entering two different coordinates into Google Maps and seeing the distance between them.

3) <a id="#three"></a> Many more are not accounted for due to the ways in which people were relocated (as in, many could have been sent there directly, others through assembly centres, etc.).  Some were even allowed to be free on some set conditions, which you can read about <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans#Exclusion,_removal,_and_detention>here</a>.

4) <a id="#four"></a> There are many different reasons people were relocated, including but not limited to: causing trouble, camp closures, and illness.
